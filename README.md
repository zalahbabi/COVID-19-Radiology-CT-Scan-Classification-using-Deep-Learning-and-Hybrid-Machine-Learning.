# COVID-19-Radiology-CT-Scan-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-and-Hybrid-Machine-Learning.
Classifies COVID-19 Radiology CT scans using multiple ML approaches: a custom CNN, fine-tuned pretrained models (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16), and hybrid pipelines using deep features with KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, specificity.
